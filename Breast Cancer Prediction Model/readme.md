Final Project for BAN 210 aimed to implement, test and document Predictive Analytics model for the Breast Cancer dataset.<b/>
Goal: Determine the better mode using two different algorithms aimed to predict the class or local recurrence of breast cancer on a patient. <b/>

Conclusion: Logistic Regression is the better model to be used compared to Decision Tree to predict the recurrence of cancer in a patient as it as it has lower ASE and misclassification rate which means it would be able to better predict the outcomes of the target variable.
